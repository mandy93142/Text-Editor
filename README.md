Link to Website: https://text-editor-5ohs.onrender.com

## Overview
Develop a single-page text editor that functions as a PWA and uses data persistence strategies. This editor must work offline and reliably save and retrieve data.

### Key Features
- Single-page application meeting PWA criteria.
- Data persistence using IndexedDB.
- Offline functionality.
- Full-stack application.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML/CSS**: For structuring and styling the web application.
- **JavaScript/ES6**: The core programming language used.
- **Node.js**: For the backend environment.
- **Express.js**: Node.js framework for handling server-side logic.
- **Webpack**: Module bundler for JavaScript files.
- **Babel**: JavaScript compiler for using next-gen JavaScript features.
- **IndexedDB**: Browser-based database for storing data locally.
- **idb**: A wrapper library for IndexedDB.
- **Service Workers**: For offline capabilities and resource caching.
- **Workbox**: For simplifying service worker management.
- **npm**: As a package manager.
- **Render**: For deployment of the full-stack application.

### Installation
1. Clone the starter code.
2. Run `npm install` in the project directory.

### Running the Application
1. Execute `npm run start` in the root directory.
2. The backend starts and the client is served.

## Features and Usage

- **Structured Client-Server Setup**: Visible upon opening the application in an editor.
- **Webpack Bundling**: Bundles JavaScript files using webpack.
- **Generated Files**: Webpack plugins generate HTML, service worker, and manifest files.
- **Next-gen JavaScript Support**: No browser errors with modern JavaScript.
- **IndexedDB Database**: Automatically created upon opening the application.
- **Data Persistence**: Saves and retrieves data using IndexedDB.
- **Desktop Installation**: 'Install' button for desktop application.
- **Service Worker with Workbox**: Pre-caches static assets.
- **Deployment Ready**: Build scripts for deployment on Render.
